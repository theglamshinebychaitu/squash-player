**About this App**

The Squash Players app is the easy and fun way to keep a lifelong record of the outcome of your squash matches, and so much more.

The Squash Players app doesn’t care if you’re an occasional social player, a retired player, a regular club player, or top squash pro.

To record a squash match, simply enter:

- The venue
- Your opponent
- The date
- The score

We aim for maximum flexibility with the scoring. We assume that the maximum number of games in a match is 3, and that at least 1 game has to be won for a match to be considered a match. Therefore the only scores that are NOT accepted are 0-0 and 3-3. All other combinations (including draws) are totally fine by us.
